Package a WDL and its imports into a zip file.

The zip file can be used as a valid imports zip for `cromwell
<https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell>`_. It can also be used to archive
your workflow.

Wdl-packager can create zip packages that are `binary reproducible
<https://reproducible-builds.org/>`_ when used with the ``--reproducible``
flag. It can also include additional files such as licenses, READMEs and
example configuration files. This makes it ideal for distributing WDL workflows
as packages.

Wdl-packager currently only supports file based imports.

Usage
-----

.. code-block:: text

    usage: wdl-packager [-h] [-o OUTPUT] [-a ADDITIONAL_FILES]
                        [--use-git-version-name] [--use-git-commit-timestamp]
                        [--reproducible] [--version]
                        WDL_FILE

    positional arguments:
      WDL_FILE              The WDL file that will be packaged.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                            The output zip file. By default uses the name of the
                            input. This overrides the git name option.
      -a ADDITIONAL_FILES, --additional-file ADDITIONAL_FILES
                            Additional files to be included in the zip. Additional
                            files will be added according to their relative
                            position to the WDL file. If that is not possible they
                            will be added to the base of the zip. Multiple '-a'
                            flags can be used.
      --use-git-version-name
                            Use git describe to determine the name of the zip.
      --use-git-commit-timestamp
                            Use the git commit timestamp to timestamp all the
                            files in the zip.
      --reproducible        shorthand for --use-git-version-name and --use-git-
                            commit-timestamp
      --version             show program's version number and exit

Reproducibility
---------------
The internal process to create a reproducible package is as follows:

+ It checks each file with ``git log --n1 --pretty=%at`` to get the unix
  timestamp of the latest commit that affected that file.
+ Each file is then copied to a temporary directory where the last modified
  time is changed to the unix timestamp found in the first step.
+ The list of files is then sorted by their destination path in the zip. The
  sorting ensures that the files will always be added in the same order.
+ The timezone of the process is changed to UTC, as the timezone affects the
  timestamp of the files in the zip archive.
+ The files are added to the zip package in sorted order.

The name for a reproducible package consists of

+ The WDL file basename without ``.wdl``.
+ A version description by ``git describe --always``.
+ A ``.zip`` extension.

Known issues
------------
+ Old versions of `Cromwell <https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell>`_
  contain a bug that causes a crash when opening zip files with nested
  directories. This was fixed in cromwell version 49.
+ ``http://`` imports are currently not supported. Wdl-packager could be an
  ideal tool to fetch WDLs from the web and package their imports in such a
  way that they can be used locally. Unfortunately this requires rewriting the
  import paths inside the WDL files before they are packaged. This is
  non-trivial to implement and it may have unintentioned side effects.
+ When packaging reproducibly the timezone of the python process needs to be
  changed to 'UTC'. Otherwise the last modified times in the zip will differ
  for each timezone. This will affect all code run in the same process. This
  does not matter for wdl-packager itself, but it does matter for programs that
  use wdl_packager as a library. Not using ``use_git_timestamps`` circumvents
  this problem.
